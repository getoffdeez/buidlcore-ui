# BUIDL Core Design Kit V1

Welcome to the BUIDL Core DesignKit v.2.1.0, brought to you by District Labs. This is an essential toolkit tailored for Turbo.eth developers and designers, striving to set a user-friendly design standard that democratizes and streamlines Web3 development. Our goal is to make building on Web3 accessible and efficient with a well-defined and easy-to-use design system.
